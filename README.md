# Nudge

A Google Chrome new tab extension that saves links, images, and other content for future processing. To prompt you to process your saved items, Nudge:

- Reminds you how long it's been since you last saved a particular item
- Displays your saved items every time you open a new tab, making them unavoidable
- Removes saved items after 30 days
